EXTRA INFO
=====================================================
I used 2 late days for this assignment.

Had many troubles implementing shading. This is where I
spent most of my time. I think it would be helpful in the
future to give more hints with respect to surface normals
and vertex vs fragment shading.

I estimate I spent about 30-40 hours working on the
assignment and couldn't complete it. I would suggest
some simplification for students in the future.
